This will serve as the repository for my BackendCore Week 2 Day 1 Notes and Homework. 
Today we learned about dictionaries and how to minipulate them. 
For the homerwork i ran into a lot of issues and i think i made it a little more complicated then it needed to be. 
I had to look up alot of things just to get it to work.
In the future i plan to take it one step at a time and practice solving the homework problems as if they were whiteboards and really methodicly think of the straight way to solve the issue. 
Instead of going straight to buiilding an entire program.
